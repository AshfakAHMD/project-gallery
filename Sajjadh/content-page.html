        <h3>Threats to Marine Biodiversity</h3>
        <p>Sri Lanka's marine biodiversity faces several threats, including overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. Overfishing is a significant concern, with unsustainable practices depleting fish stocks and disrupting marine ecosystems. Habitat destruction occurs through coastal development, mangrove clearance, and coral reef degradation, impacting breeding grounds and nurseries for marine species. Pollution, including plastic waste and untreated sewage, further jeopardizes marine life and coastal ecosystems, posing health risks to both wildlife and human communities.</p>

        <h3>Conservation Initiatives and Strategies</h3>
        <p>In response to these challenges, Sri Lankan ocean conservationists employ various strategies to protect marine biodiversity. Conservation efforts focus on establishing marine protected areas (MPAs) that safeguard critical habitats like coral reefs, mangroves, and seagrass beds. Collaborative initiatives with local communities promote sustainable fishing practices, reduce bycatch, and encourage the adoption of eco-friendly alternatives. Research plays a pivotal role in understanding species dynamics, ecosystem resilience, and the impacts of climate change on marine environments, informing evidence-based conservation policies and management practices.</p>

        <h3>Community Engagement and Education</h3>
        <p>Community engagement and education are integral to the success of marine conservation in Sri Lanka. Conservationists work closely with coastal communities, raising awareness about the importance of marine biodiversity and empowering locals to become stewards of their marine resources. Educational programs in schools and community centers educate youth about sustainable fishing, marine ecology, and the benefits of preserving coastal ecosystems. Eco-tourism initiatives promote responsible tourism practices that minimize environmental impact while generating economic opportunities for coastal communities, thereby fostering a sustainable balance between conservation and livelihoods.</p>

        <p>By addressing these sub-topics, Sri Lankan ocean conservationists aim to mitigate threats to marine biodiversity, promote sustainable practices, and ensure the long-term health and resilience of the island's coastal and marine environments.</p>
